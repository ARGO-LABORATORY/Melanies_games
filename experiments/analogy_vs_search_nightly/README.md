# Experiment: ANALOGY vs SEARCH (decorrelated book openings)

Head-to-head between two Melanie variants over **4 balanced opening positions**
(`openings_book.json`), **each played both colors**. `R_QAP=64` on both sides; analogy takes
over right after the book. Each game folder has `game.pgn` + both per-side report PDFs + reproducible
`thoughts/`. A Stockfish move-quality verdict (per-side ACPL) is appended after the match.

## Score (run `analogy_vs_search_nightly`)

**ANALOGY 2 — 3 SEARCH**  (draws: 3, games: 8)
